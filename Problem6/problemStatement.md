The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 385$. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is , $(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)^2$ = 3025.Hence the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the squares of the sum is $3025-385 = 2640$.

Find the absolute difference between the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers and the square of the sum.
